                                The highly sophisticated and comprehensive martial art from the Philippines is weapon based, but ultimately an empty hand system.

                                The Filipino program introduces students to 12 main areas, including, but not limited to single stick, double stick, stick & dagger, double dagger, panatukan (Filipino boxing), sikaran (Filipino kicking methods), spear, sarong and projectiles.

                                In the US as long ago as the 1500′s, the Filipino Martial Arts have something to benefit everyone. Developed for “mass attack” as well as single opponent confrontations, the training heightens student’s awareness of their surroundings and teaches them to use their environment as tools of combat.

                                Everyday objects, such as umbrellas, books, bandannas, etc., become effective means of self-defense in the hands of a properly trained individual.
                            
                                Use of left and right hand techniques develop coordination. Drills and techniques taught in a fluid, non-restrictive manner allow students to enhance their natural attributes and improve their sense of  balance, coordination, agility, timing, speed, awareness and confidence.
